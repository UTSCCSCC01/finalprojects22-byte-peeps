## Sprint 3 Planning Meeting

- Meeting was held Wednesday 6th July 2022.
- After conduing the sprint retropective, we discussed how we should proceed with sprint 3.
- We decided that we will be basing the sprint on having complete pages that are based on complete functionality.

## Sprint goal

Having complete social media analysis pages.

## Team Capacity

Since we managed to complete almost all of goals last sprint, despite one of our teammates being sick, we decided that we will continue with a similar sprint velocity which is again broken down by expertise and/or wanted to obtain new experience in a particular feature.

## Spikes

- Google My Busines API: attempting to fetch reviews from this endpoint and obtaining OAuth2 access to user's Business Accounts. Unfortuantely it was not possible to complete for this sprint. This was highlighted in the Jira ticket BYT-29 with a flag and the explanation is copied below:

```
Unfortunately, this ticket cannot be completed since we needed to sign up to use the Business Profile API associated with Google My Business which was supposed to be completed in a previous ticket assigned for Sprint 1. The sign up application is not guaranteed and it can take up to 2 weeks thus we are not sure if we will be able to implement this feature in the future either.
```

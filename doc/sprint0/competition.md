Our project idea is based on the [MyCustomerLens](https://mycustomerlens.com/) product which is a customer-relationship management (CRM) that gives 
users software that performs many of the key features that we have laid out in our other sprint 0 documents. However, 
MyCustomerLens seems to primarily be catered towards accounting and law firms as well as consultants whereas our product
has a more general target audience as outlined by, but not limited to, our personas document - small-business owners, 
and content creators.

There are a few other companies that provide similar CRM software such as [SalesForce](https://www.salesforce.com/ca/) and 
[Microsoft Dynamic 365](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/) but these can be quite expensive since they are geared 
towards larger companies with formal teams to tackle CRM-based topics. For example, Microsoft Dynamic 365 is $1,500 per 
user. Furthermore, the software can be difficult to use for certain audiences such as our Walter persona due to the 
large number of features. Our product would attempt to improve the user experience by providing the most crucial 
features and summary pages for the less technologically inclined.

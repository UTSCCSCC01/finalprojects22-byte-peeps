2. All requirements outlined on the acceptance criteria for the corresponding user story are met. 
3. The feature is tested by the developer and at least one other team member to ensure it does not cause any unwanted behaviour or break the existing codebase.
   * If possible, automated tests should be written and passed.
4. The code for a feature has been reviewed by at least one other team member (for mistakes and readability) and merged through a pull request.

# The Process

## Team Organization
Initially, the team started with two members. After receiving several interests, we presented the candidates to the team and voted collectively for those who eventually joined us based on their skill and the team’s needs.

Once a full team was formed, we aimed for dividing tasks equally using the marking scheme. Each member chose their favourable task, some exchanged tasks to reach a common ground. The final outcome is as follows:
* Giani: summary.md
* Mohamed Tayeh: setup.md, documentation.md
* Gloria: Product Backlog
* Domi: done.md, competition.md, team agreement
* Connie: personas.md
* Bassel/Juan: user experience, process.md

## Tools
For the planning phase, our team used the following tools:
* Voting:
    * Simple Poll bot on Discord: Used for quick polling and decision making.
    * Strawpoll: Used for polls that required anonymous voting.
* Documentation:
    * Google Docs: Used for ‘official’ documents that required sharing/collaboration.
    * Discord channels: Used to document decisions and discussions by category.
* Prototyping (UX/UI):
    * Figma

From a technical perspective, our team has democratically chosen to use:
    * Frontend: React
    * Backend: NodeJS, SQL, Express

## Decision Making
Important decisions such as the selection of the project’s idea and the frameworks to use were first discussed in meetings with the presence and participation of the whole team. Then, supporting tools (like the voting tools presented above) were used to document and officialize the final decision.

Secondary decisions such as task allocation, meeting times, and tutorial to attend were done through polls on our #project-decisions discord channel. A shared Google document was created to document some of those decisions too.

## User Stories
User story priority is based on its logical order of implementation. For example, the underlying structure of the application has to be built first before implementing its features. These stories will be discussed by the team and prioritized accordingly.

In terms of defining story points, we chose to go with planning poker. If a tie is reached, members will give reasoning to their choice of story points in order to reach a consensus. If no consensus is reached after 3 total voting rounds, a tie breaker will be applied by a volunteer who voted for a different story point.

## Meetings
In the beginning, meetings were on ad hoc basis as a result of different timelines on project ideas, decisions, and research topics. Eventually, the team decided to meet **two** times a week starting from sprint one:
* Thursdays 5:30pm to 6:30pm
* Saturdays 2:00pm to 3:00pm

Meeting notes will be taken each time for any peers who are unable to make it to the meeting, as well as for documentation.

## Lessons Learned
* During meetings, the playground should be more open for everyone to participate in minor and major decisions. This includes providing more Q&A time depending on the presented topic as well as calling out members who are not participating much to ensure they are in agreement
* Organizing the Discord channel is important to easily trace the chat when needed. We moved our chat from one channel to different categorical channels per sprint
* Whether someone was unable to make it to a meeting or needed to look back into meeting decisions, we found out that it is necessary to keep a channel for meeting notes

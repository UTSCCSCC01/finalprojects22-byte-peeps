## What are practices that you should continue during next sprint?

- Consistently finishing the sprint stories.
- Assigning work based on expertise
- Meet regularly and consistently for sprints
- Planning the based on business goals that are realistic and well structured
- Completed the tasks throughout the sprint

---

## What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint?

- There was skewness in the number of user stories that each member completes. We will be splitting the tasks more evenly.
- Not being thorough when completing account setups, this lead to a feature not being implemented as there was some missing research in terms of completing the account set up to access a required 3rd party API.

## What was your best/worst experience during sprint 3?

- Best: Having a good demo with many features to present.
- Worst: Finding that we weren't able to complete the google pipeline and authentication.
